# Final Exam code files

There are 5 code files

- Files `code1_suhas99` and `code2_suhas99` are for problem 1
    - `code1_suhas99` file gives the 3D workspace plot of the robot.
    - `code2_suhas99` file gives analytical jacobian, inverse kinematics and
the dynamics of the robot.

- Files `code3_suhas99`, `code4_suhas99` and `code5_suhas99` are for problem 3
    - `code3_suhas99` file forward kinematics angle plots for the snake robot.
    - `code4_suhas99` file goes over an attempt made for the inverse velocity
kinematics of the snake robot.
    - `code5_suhas99` file gives the graph generated by using serpentine
formula.
